# Putting-It-All-Together-Part-II
Add a public method to the Dog class called bark(), which returns "Woof!". Add a public method called greet() to the Dog class. This method ought to return a nice sentence containing the $name property of the Dog, which introduces himself. Create two instances of the Dog class and store the one with the $name "Barker" in the variable $dog1 and the other one with the $name "Amigo" in the variable $dog2. As you might have expected, call the bark() method on $dog1 and echo the result. The last one: Call the greet() method on $dog2 and echo the result.
